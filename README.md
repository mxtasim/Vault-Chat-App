# Vault Chat App (React Version)

A real-time chatting application built using **React** and **Vite**, originally created as part of my graduation project. It features a clean UI, efficient development workflow, and Firebase for backend services.

> ⚠️ This project has been succeeded by a new, advanced version built with **React Native** and **Expo** to provide a much better experience across **mobile and web** platforms. Check it out here:
